# Fake Assignment Doc Generator 📄

A simple Python script to automatically generate fake university assignment documents in `.docx` format — useful when you need to upload files to sites like CourseHero to unlock downloads. ⚙️

### Features
✅ Randomized course codes (e.g. `ABCD123`)  
✅ Randomized course names & instructor names  
✅ Randomized assignment titles & content  
✅ Dynamic learning outcomes, evaluation criteria, reference materials  
✅ Academic integrity statement  
✅ Submission guidelines  
✅ Each document looks unique — avoids obvious duplication  

### Why?
Many educational platforms (e.g. CourseHero) require users to **upload 5 documents** in exchange for **1 free resource download**. Manually preparing 5 different documents can be time-consuming — this tool helps generate realistic looking assignments in bulk.

### Example Output

- `ABCD123_task1.docx`  
- `EFGH456_task2.docx`  
- `IJKL789_task3.docx`  
...

Each `.docx` file will look like a genuine university assignment with proper sections and random content.
